## About
a whiteboard collaboration app whose aim is to enable/facilitate realtime sharing of ideas in the form of components (for example: text, images, code, etc) that can be pieced together and edited by several people in a live session, and exported at any time.

At this point in time (*v0.1.0*), the only component available is text, along with the sidebar chat (which is available to everyone, edit privileges or not).

The plan is to add components, and features (like exporting the board as text instead of image), gradually, until the project reaches its initial purpose (stated above).

This project was part of the second edition of [Learn IT, Girl](http://learnitgirl.com), and would not have been possible without the continuous mentorship, support, and tolerance of 'newbie' questions courtesy of [@daniel-j-h](https://github.com/daniel-j-h).

## Rules, Installation, and Docs

## Contributing
This is something I built to learn, so you're welcome to do the same as well. Issues (everything I want to do next) are reported here but feel free to report new issues/improvements and if all looks good, work on them. 

I added the Hacktoberfest label to some issues I think would be good for beginners (like me!) or generally more understandable (some of the other issues are missing context, I think) but again feel free to pick anything you want to work on and let me know.

What you have to do:
- Fork the repo.
- Create a branch. Work on it.
- Create a PR here with all the details/reference to the issue it solves.

[Here's a great article with more details for absolute beginners.](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/#summary)
