## About
a whiteboard collaboration app whose aim is to enable/facilitate realtime sharing of ideas in the form of components (for example: text, images, code, etc) that can be pieced together and edited by several people in a live session, and exported at any time.

At this point in time (*v0.1.0*), the only component available is text, along with the sidebar chat (which is available to everyone, edit privileges or not).

The plan is to add components, and features (like exporting the board as text instead of image), gradually, until the project reaches its initial purpose (stated above).

This project was part of the second edition of [Learn IT, Girl](http://learnitgirl.com), and would not have been possible without the continuous mentorship, support, and tolerance of 'newbie' questions courtesy of [@daniel-j-h](https://github.com/daniel-j-h).
