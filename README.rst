# Pegasus
A web app/collaboration tool that acts as a virtual whiteboard where you can draw and/or write, and share your work live with others. The idea is to enable the user to share drawings, regular text, and syntax-highlighted code live with others, who will either be given the permission to view or to edit the same board. Every board serves as a "session" which is removed upon being marked "done" by the creator. During, or after, those sessions the user can save or export the contents of the board in image or text format. The app will be developed using Flask, a micro framework for Python.
